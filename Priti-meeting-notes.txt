Meeting with Priti Kanth on 2025-04-11 at lunchtime:

Ask James Hague to characterise how wrong is the process model after calculation for some simple geometries.
Take stuff from THOR
    - OpenMC cross section converter,
    - procedure they used to calculate 1D
        - assumptions
        - data structuring

[]Read published papers from THOR - see if it's better?
[]Ask Ivo
